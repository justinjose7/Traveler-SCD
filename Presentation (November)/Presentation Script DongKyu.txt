Moving on to how we are actually going to do this...

We have realized that we don't want people to have their backpacks hooked up to them directly
for the convenience reasons.
So we had to find a way to somehow transfer the energy wirelessly. Since tens unit does not
require a lot of energy, we think that we can induced current to run the tens unit.
and the rough plan is drawn and shown here.
The basic idea is to use a potentiometer to create an oscillating current
through the solenoid which will induce the current on the pad through change in magnetic field.

 however since this is a theoratical plan
we need to test it out and do some modifications in the lab. we are also considering
replacing the potentiometer part with our pre made tens unit, depending on how it works out.

We also have a rough outline of how our final product will look like.
It is going to be a backpack obviously, with a giant solonoid to globally induce current to
several pads that will be on the user's body.

So our next steps would be to actually construct a prototype, and see if it works,
and improve it further.
and also to build on the website more.

Thank you.
