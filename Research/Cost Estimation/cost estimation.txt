$25.5, shipping $10

Realistically, a tens unit will cost about 30 bucks. (The simplest model so that we can just disect it and reuse it for our purposes.)

According to Justin Jose, a 400ft magnetic coil costed him $9. Which will make about 5 to 10 products.

The cost of backpacks depend on the brand. So we will probably have our cost adjusted in terms of the quality of the backpack if we were to sell.


THIS IS ALL HYPOTHETICAL FROM THIS LINE BEYOND.

Assuming that we can cut down 20% of the $30 with the economies of scale and saving on shipping costs for ordering multiple products, and
9 dollars worth of magnetic coil will produce 10 products with the economies of scale

It will be

The cost of backpack + $24.9.

This does not include any of the manufactoring costs. Winding up a coil from the copper wire and putting them into a backpack is not a lot of work.
So I think the manufactoring cost should be less than 5%. Assuming 5% the cost becomes,

C(backpack)*1.05 + $26.2

The margin should be at least 50%, and there is the cost of shipping (assuming $10)

C(backpack)*1.575 + $54.3

So a backpack worth of $30 will result in a product that is roughly $100.
