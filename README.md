## Summary:
  This engineering design groups aims at marketing a value proposition to the "World Traveler" customer segment. 
  We started this approach based purely on conjecture, and our own experiences. However, through multiples instances of
  research in the field, we've learnt much about the pains of our customer segment. Through new research, we've been able to
  refine our value proposition, and are continuing to refine and gather new information about the relation of our proposed
  production and customer segment.

# Customer Segment:
  Our customer segment is defined as follows:
  1) 18-30 years old
  2) World Traveling backpacker
  
# Our Start: the initial value proposition
  We started off tackling this customer segment with the idea of a smart connceted keychain. The idea was that this keychian
  would connect via bluetooth to one's phone, and would alert them if the keychain (or any possesions connected) were left
  behind. We thought this was a perfect product for a World Travler, as they have to maintain a budget and schedule, and cannot
  afford to lose their belongings â€“ boy we're we wrong.
