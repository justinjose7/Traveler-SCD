## Summary:
  This engineering design groups aims at marketing a smart connected device (SCD) to the "World Traveler" customer segment. 
  We started this approach based purely on conjecture, and our own experiences. However, through multiples instances of
  research in the field, we've learnt much about the pains of our customer segment. Through new research, we've been able to
  refine our value proposition, and are continuing to refine and gather new information about the relation of our proposed
  production and customer segment.

## Customer Segment:
  Our customer segment is defined as follows:
  1) 18-30 years old
  2) World Traveling backpacker
  
## Our Start: the initial value proposition
  We started off tackling this customer segment with the idea of a smart connceted keychain. The idea was that this keychian
  would connect via bluetooth to one's phone, and would alert them if the keychain (or any possesions connected) were left
  behind. We thought this was a perfect product for a World Travler, as they have to maintain a budget and schedule, and cannot
  afford to lose their belongings â€“ boy we're we wrong.

## Primary Interviews:
  We conducted our primary interviews with the motive to validate our initial value proposition. We interviewd world travelers
  in both Grand Central and Times Square, asking what their largest concern whilst traveling was. We discovered that item loss
  whilst traveling was at the very bottom of their list of concerns. In fact, many of their largest concerns (such as time & 
  money management) were problems that had no room for an SCD (as they were being sufficently solved by simply using a
  smart-phone). When we reorganized the data from gained from these interviews to only concerns with room for an SCD, we saw
  that safety was their largest concern.
##### We then scraped our initial value proposition (the smart keychain).

## New possibilities to explore:
  We decided to tackle this new-found concern of safety in two avenues: saftey of person (security), and health saftey.
  These new possibliites caused us to think of two new products: 1) a portable home security device, to take and quikcly
  implement in your hostle or bed & breakfeast. 2) a backpack that implemented a tens unit to relax back and shoulder muscles on
  whilst traveling.
