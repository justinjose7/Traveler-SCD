# Summary:
  This engineering design groups aims at marketing a value proposition to the "World Traveler" customer segment. 
  We started this approach based purely on conjecture, and our own experiences. However, through multiples instances of
  research in the field, we've learnt much about the pains of our customer segment. Through new research, we've been able to
  refine our value proposition, and are continuing to refine and gather new information about the relation of our proposed
  production and customer segment.
