## So what now?
  We need to go back into the field and further validate our current value propositon of the backpack-tens unit device.
  If it is indedd validated by interviews, we can move onto prototyping of the device. If it is not, we must re-evaluate
  our customer segments concerns and come up with a more fitting product to market. However we are confident that our current
  idea is thebomb.com!
  
#### Read the below information to understand the journey to our current position: "So what now?"

### Summary:
  This engineering design groups aims at marketing a smart connected device (SCD) to the "World Traveler" customer segment. 
  We started this approach based purely on conjecture, and our own experiences. However, through multiples instances of
  research in the field, we've learnt much about the pains of our customer segment. Through new research, we've been able to
  refine our value proposition, and are continuing to refine and gather new information about the relation of our proposed
  production and customer segment.

### Customer Segment:
  Our customer segment is defined as follows:
  1) 18-30 years old
  2) World Traveling backpacker
  
### Our Start: the initial value proposition
  We started off tackling this customer segment with the idea of a smart connceted keychain. The idea was that this keychian
  would connect via bluetooth to one's phone, and would alert them if the keychain (or any possesions connected) were left
  behind. We thought this was a perfect product for a World Travler, as they have to maintain a budget and schedule, and cannot
  afford to lose their belongings â€“ boy we're we wrong.

### Primary Interviews:
  We conducted our primary interviews with the motive to validate our initial value proposition. We interviewd world travelers
  in both Grand Central and Times Square, asking what their largest concern whilst traveling was. We discovered that item loss
  whilst traveling was at the very bottom of their list of concerns. In fact, many of their largest concerns (such as time & 
  money management) were problems that had no room for an SCD (as they were being sufficently solved by simply using a
  smart-phone). When we reorganized the data from gained from these interviews to only concerns with room for an SCD, we saw
  that safety was their largest concern.
##### We then scraped our initial value proposition (the smart keychain).

### New possibilities to explore:
  We decided to tackle this new-found concern of safety in two avenues: saftey of person (security), and health saftey.
  These new possibliites caused us to think of two new products: 1) a portable home security device, to take and quikcly
  implement in your hostle or bed & breakfeast. 2) a backpack that implemented a tens unit to relax back and shoulder muscles on
  whilst traveling.

### Secondary Interviews:
  With these two new product ideas in mind, we headed back to Grand Central to quesiton world travelers on their more specfic
  concerns of saftey. From these interviews, we gathered that 2 in 8 people were concerned about their own security in the
  places of stay (whilst travling). Others believed their hostles (or other places of stay) where safe/had the nesccissary
  precautions to ensure saftey already in palce. This information detered us form the portable home secuirty idea.
  
  However, when we asked about back and should pain whilst traveling, we got an overwhelming conformation of the problem. 
  Interviewees confirmed that their backpacks, and extended periods of sitting on buses or planes, caused noticable back and 
  should pain. When asked about their current solution to the problem, many said they would like to go to a massage parlour,
  however they believed that it would be too expense, and they were to unfamiliar with the country of travel to attempt to find 
  one.
##### This data collected from the secondary interviews has pointed us in the direction of a muscle pain-relieving product for travelers.

### Current Value Propostion:
  We are currently exploring the idea of combining a backpack with a tens unit. A tens unit is a commonly used physio-therapy
  device that relaxes muscles through electrical impulses. By merging these two products, travlers could aliveate their muscle 
  pain without having to scratch off any events on their itinterary. This deivce would be connected to one's phone, so that
  one could look at the log of the tens unit's use (time of day & time of use), as well as prevent excess use of the device for
  saftey reasons.
